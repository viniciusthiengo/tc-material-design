===========================================

[Versão em português](https://github.com/viniciusthiengo/tc-material-design/blob/master/README.md)

## Project ##

TCMaterialDesign is an APP developed on Thiengo's Calopsita YouTube Channel in a way to teache others how to develope an Android APP.

In the begin this APP was developed just to be part of a serie named Material Design on Android, but it is supposed to be easier to understanding other Android videos in a channel if we keep working on a real APP, since then this APP is now an official example APP of Thiengo's Blog and Channels.

*Note that there is a second part of this project, I meant, a server side part where we have some PHP scripts those were tested in a Apache 2.2 (no big deal if you are using NGINX, it's supposed to works fine too) using also an MySQL like an official SGBD of this project. [Go here to access this second part](https://github.com/viniciusthiengo/tc-material-design-web)*

## Install / Import ##

Fork or download the project, then using AndroidStudio just click in "import" and browse to this project and open it, done.

### Server-Side ###

Since video [Volley, Gson e RetryPolicy em Material Design Android Série APP](http://www.thiengo.com.br/volley-gson-e-retrypolicy-em-material-design-android-serie-app) this APP project started to count with a server-side code (Apache / PHP / MySQL) to deliver the needed data: [tc-material-design-web](https://github.com/viniciusthiengo/tc-material-design-web)
